Translations
============

Creating a new translation
--------------------------

Install Poedit

.. code:: bash

    sudo apt-get install poedit

Create POT file:

.. code:: bash

    make translatefile

Create translation from POT:

.. image:: ../_static/create_translation.*

Open POT:

.. image:: ../_static/open_pot.*

Choose language:

.. image:: ../_static/pot_choose_language.*

Translate the text and save PO in ``./translations``:

.. image:: ../_static/translations_save_po.*

Compile to MO:

.. code:: bash

    make translations


Updating a translation
----------------------

Lets contemplate the scenario where the developers added more strings / messages to the application. Now we need to
make a translation for these new strings.


Create POT file again:

.. code:: bash

    make translatefile

Open your previous PO file (located in ``./translations``) and update it from the new POT.

.. image:: ../_static/translations_update_from_pot.*

The new strings are added to the PO file. Translate them, save and compile:

.. code:: bash

    make translations


Adding translation to the application
-------------------------------------

So your PO file is ready to use, but how?

Add the name of the language in upper case (it should match ``[A-Z_]+``) as the key of ``LANGUAGES`` and use the name of
the PO file (without the extension) as the value:

.. image:: ../_static/translations_language_py.*

After restarting the application the new language is displayed as a choice:

.. image:: ../_static/translations_app.*
